# BrickMania

**BrickMania** is a modern take on the classic **BrickBreaker** game.

The game is currently under development, and I plan to implement numerous updates and changes to the code. (Stay tuned for future updates!)

A special thanks to [@khsaad](https://github.com/khsaad04), [@Aarthex](https://github.com/Amulet9) for their contributions.

## How to Play

### Keyboard Controls

- Move the block using the **WASD** or **Arrow** keys.
- Pause or resume the game by pressing the **Spacebar**.
- To quit the game while it’s not running, press the **Q** key.

### Options

On the start menu, you can select certain options that modify gameplay. Currently, these settings do not persist across restarts, but this feature is planned for future updates.

You can navigate the options using the arrow keys.

- **Mute Music**: Mutes the game’s music.

### Special Moves

Special moves are powerful abilities with cooldowns. There are currently **2** special moves available:

- Every 20 seconds, you’ll gain a **SUPER Ball**, which is red in color. You can activate it by pressing either the **W** key or the **Down Arrow** key.
  
- Every 60 seconds, you’ll unlock the **Brick Destruction** powerup, which instantly destroys all remaining bricks on the board.

### Powerups

Powerups are items that drop randomly as you play, either after destroying bricks or at specific intervals.

- After breaking a brick, there’s a chance an **Extra Ball** powerup will begin to fall. Catch it, and you’ll gain an additional ball that can help you clear more bricks! However, be cautious—each extra ball makes the game significantly faster!

Enjoy the game, and be on the lookout for new updates in the future!
